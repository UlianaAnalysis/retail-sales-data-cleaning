# Data Quality Audit & Cleaning Pipeline #    
  
### Retail Sales Data Cleaning Challenge ###
### 🔎 Project Overview ###

This project focuses on auditing and improving the quality of a retail sales dataset containing transactional records with intentional inconsistencies, missing values, and structural issues.

The objective was to design a structured data quality assessment and cleaning pipeline to prepare the dataset for reliable business reporting and downstream analytics.

This project simulates a real-world scenario where analytics teams experience inconsistent KPIs due to poor data quality.

### 🎯 Business Scenario ###

The analytics team reported discrepancies in monthly revenue and customer reporting. Preliminary investigation revealed:
* Missing customer and product information
* Duplicate transactions
* Invalid numeric values (e.g., negative prices or quantities)
* Inconsistent date formats
* Incomplete category data

**My role was to:**

1. Perform a structured data quality audit
2. Quantify data issues and assess business impact
3. Design and implement a cleaning pipeline
4. Validate improvements
5. Deliver an analysis-ready dataset
